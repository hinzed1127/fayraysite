This is the website for Chicago-based group [Fay Ray](http://www.fayray.band/), built and maintained by me.

Among other things, it uses [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/), and a whole lot of vanilla CSS animations.
